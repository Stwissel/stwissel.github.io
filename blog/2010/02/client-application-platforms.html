					<hr />
					<div>There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">wonderful</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">awesome</a> strategies how to organize your data centers and back-end data processing. Often these back-ends are supposed to be accessed by " <i>Thin Clients</i>", replacing " <i> <strike> Sick </strike>Thick Clients</i>" or " <i>Fat Clients</i>" which are considered " <i>legacy</i> (read: tried, tested and boring)". Looking at the memory foot print of modern browsers I can't see the "thin" part. My guess the "thin" actually should mean: " <i>Comes with the Oerating System and doedn't need to be taken care of</i>." Never mind the security patches and frequent updates. The opponents of "Thin Clients" coined the term " <i>Rich Client</i>" which indicates connectedness and rich interaction models. The IMHO real difference is single purpose, disconnected clients (like your old school spreadsheet, minus Quickr/Sharepoint) vs. connected application platforms. And looking at the platforms the dust hasn't settled (yet). Regardless of what platform one picks, the challenge today is <b>device diversity</b>. You might have standardized on X, but you can make a save bet, that a C level executive will hand you a device Y and demands to make it work for your enterprise applications (typically Y ��� [iPhone, Palm Pre, Blackberry, Android, {Stuff-you-never-heard-of}]). Anyhow you face the real-estate challenge: 
<br> 
<img src="/blog/images/2010/ScreenSizes.jpg" border="0" alt="1920x1200 is 30x bigger than 320x240"> 
<br> Your 24" monitor (60.96cm for readers who live in the EU) with its 1920x1200 resolution shows 30x more pixels than the small smart phone with its 320x240 screen. Your strategy should allow for as much reuse as possible. Here are the current options as seen through my personal bias: 
<ul> 
 <li style="list-style-type: square"><b>HTML</b>: To be correct you would need to state: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM. With the raise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">Ajax</a> (Sometimes available technologies "just" need a name to become popular) this seems to be the predominant direction most enterprise developers are taking. Supported by frameworks like <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ajax_frameworks">others</a> creating rich interaction became way simpler. IBM settled on the Dojo toolkit for all their products, so learning Dojo is a worthwhile investment. Luckily by now here is rich documentation both <a href="http://docs.dojocampus.org/">online</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516487?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wissenetblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596516487">offline</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wissenetblog-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596516487" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin:0px !important;"> available.<br> The base line for this approach is support for IE6 which severely limits the platform. If you don't use any of the toolkits you are also hampered by little incompatibilities between the browsers (Quirx mode anyone). Further challenges are (not complete): the lack of local storage other than cookies, no native media capabilities and no uniform extension model. Clearly a legacy platform. This highlights a <b>big dilemma</b> for "thin clients": The browser available on the workstation <b>does matter</b> and the idea of "everything on the server" stays a pipe dream. While all you need to develop in HTML is gEdit (notepad if you are on Windows), you want to use a <a href="http://www.aptana.org/">powerful IDE</a> and a <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">strong debugger</a><br>&nbsp; </li> 
 <li style="list-style-type: square"><b>HTML5</b>: This includes CSS3 and a host of new capabilities like &lt;canvas&gt; or &lt;video&gt;. The most prominent representative of HTML5 execution environment is <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a>, the engine powering <a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> and <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/Applications%20using%20WebKit">others</a>. Webkit is also used in iPhone, iPod/Pad, Android and Nokia's Symbian S60 platforms. So WebKit is well positioned for both mobile and PC space. <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> also support HTML5. HTML5 provides local storage which let Google to abandon their own toolkit for that (Google Gears). Notably absent from full support for HTML5 is Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8.<br> HTML5 is still a very young standard, so some implementation hiccups can be expected (just check for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=HTML+5+video+codec">video support</a>) across browsers. Using the same toolkits as mentioned above, you have a save strategy going forward. What HTML5 currently doesn't resolve is cross domain aggregation, this stays a server side task. IBM has committed to HTML5 (not only) as part of <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/insidelotusblog.nsf/dx/ibm-project-vulcan-demo">Project Vulcan</a>. IBM also spend quite some effort to design a style guide (called <a href="http://www-12.lotus.com/ldd/doc/oneuidoc/docpublic/index.htm">IBM OneUI</a>) to ease design decisions for developers. What HTML and HTML5 don't define is the communication between individual modules. Here independent specifications like <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/mashupswiki.nsf/dx/iwidget-spec-v1.0.pdf/$file/iwidget-spec-v1.0.pdf">iWidgets</a> (Part of <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/">OpenSocial</a>) need to fill that gap </li> 
</ul><ul> 
 <li style="list-style-type: square"><b>dotNet / Silverlight</b>: Realizing the limitations of HTML and the imminent loss of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">The API War</a> Microsoft positions dotNet and its descendant Silverlight as application platform (this is not about ASP.net, that's server technology). dotNet clients can read/write server data via HTTP and qualify as "Rich Clients". They also can run off an URL. Still they were perceived as "old school", so Silverlight adds the capability to start inside a browser and break out to take full advantage of the dotNet framework while coding HTML and CSS. The dotNet framework is considered complete and mature (albeit with little regard for backward compatibility). While Microsoft's Silverlight supports <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/silverlight.html">Mac</a> and via <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a> even Linux, it is seen as "Microsoft proprietary" and has gained limited popularity. Most notably absent is <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/mobile/">support</a> for mobile platforms other than Windows Mobile and there it is a version behind. Support for Nokia S60 had been announced, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Silverlight+S60+site%3Anokia.com">look for yourself</a>. You develop Silverlight applications in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse4sl.org/">Eclipse</a> or <a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>. Mono also has branch of their tool for the iPhone/iPad called <a href="http://www.monotouch.net/">MonoTouch</a> (but not for Androd or Symbian S60)<br>&nbsp; </li> 
 <li style="list-style-type: square"><b>Flash / AIR</b>: Adobe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> started as animation platform and has successfully been transformed into an application platform. Its programming language ActionScript is a sibling to JavaScript and in its standalone version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Air">AIR</a> you even can use the Dojo Toolkit. AIR gained rapid popularity in the web development community, but has limited success in enterprise deployments (of course I happily stand corrected). AIR and Flash support is limited on mobile devices and non-existent so far for Windows Phone 7 and Apple iPhone/iPad (Adobe is <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/adobe_air_coming_to_mobile_devices/">working on that</a>). You develop AIR applications using Dreamweaver, Flash CS4 or Flex Builder (based on the Eclipse IDE)<br>&nbsp; </li> 
 <li style="list-style-type: square"><b>Java / JavaFX</b>: From the beginning Java was able to run via the network; Java applets in the browser and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp">Java Web Start</a> from the OS/Command Line/Shortcut. While it looked like a sure winner, creating Java UIs turned out to be somewhere between clumsy to outright painful. Several attempts (<a href="http://www.developer.com/java/ent/article.php/3589961/Building-Java-GUIs-with-Matisse-A-Gentle-Introduction.htm">Matisse</a>, <a href="http://javaboutique.internet.com/tutorials/thinletone/">Thinlets</a> or <a href="http://xul.sourceforge.net/">XUL</a>) didn't get very far, so SUN created <a href="http://javafx.com/">JavaFX</a> as direct response to Silverlight and AIR. JavaFX takes advantage of an existing JVM (which needs to be current). JavaFX has been seen on Android mobiles as demo, but is absent from Apple or Symbian (for now?). You develop JavaFX using your favorite Java IDE (Netbeans or Eclipse)<br>&nbsp; </li> 
 <li style="list-style-type: square"><b>Eclipse / Lotus Expeditor</b>: Eclipse started as IBM sponsored development platform. Very early it also was used as platform for application development and since Eclipse version 3 the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rcp/">Rich Client Platform</a> is a top level project of the Eclipse foundation. Eclipse is going one step further that all the other platforms. It prescribes a certain development model. Individual parts of a UI are views and editors that are combined into perspectives that form a UI. Perspectives can be pre-defined or user created. A mechanism how components call each other and/or depend on each other allows to compose applications in a very modular fashion. A number of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/community/rcp.php">Case Studies</a> highlight the concept and advantages. Eclipse RCP is Java centric but allows the use of an embedded browser (e.g. XULRunner, the Mozilla engine) or other languages. Eclipse RCP comes with a rather steep <a href="http://www.vogella.de/articles/RichClientPlatform/article.html">learning curve</a>.<br> IBM extended the Eclipse RCP platform with <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/expeditor/">Lotus Expeditor</a>. It adds to RCP standard capabilities like remote management, an account API, local SQL database (DB/2 Anyplace), encryption, web and Portal container (so you can run your HTML5 applications locally), synchronization <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/expeditor-intro/">and more</a>. Expeditor is available for desktops (Win/Linux/Mac) and some mobile devices (it is absent from Apple/Android and limited on the other platforms e.g. no Portlet container).<br> Its capability to use Portal like wires to link properties and methods of components to composite applications are key for successful enterprise integration clients (when you have to <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/expeditor/applications.html">reuse existing assets</a>). With the help of <a href="http://www.openspan.com/">OpenSpan</a> one even can integrate legacy applications including defining wires to other modules. So the big differentiator is the <b>component diversity</b> Expeditor allows you to use. The platforms mentioned above allow you to do whatever you want, as long as you stick to the platform's language and single approach.<br> Expeditor on the other hand <i>prescribes</i> quite some of the UI (Menu, Toolbar, Perspectives, Sidebar) and module communication (Property Broker) but allows to mix and match what(ever) you have. Also, other than the platforms mentioned above, Expeditor is not free, but <b>needs to be licensed</b> (a potential show stopper for wide public adoption, but a common pratice for extensions to a base platform) or acquired (partly) with one of the IBM Expeditor applications: <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/notesanddomino/">Lotus Notes</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/sametime/">Lotus Sametime</a> or <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/">Lotus Symphony</a>. Expeditor clients can be remotely administrated, including role based deployments, from Websphere Portal, Lotus Domino or an Expeditor server. Expeditor has an unique capability to create mashups across domain and technology boundaries. HTML can be mixed with Swing, SWT and Portlets. Classic Notes components can be linked to Symphony documents and two totally unrelated web sited (of different security context) can be matched together to feed e.g. a spreadsheet. All this includes the ability to work offline or render the UI locally but work with remote data using a large array of communication options like HTTP, MQ, remote Portlets etc. Even communication via terminal commands (e.g. 3270 or 5250) is possible. <br> <img src="/blog/images/2010/Expeditor.jpg" border="0" alt="Expeditor Client side aggregation"> <br> It might initially feels as slick and pretty, but allows real world application integration, online and offline. But as we know with great powers <strike> come great responsibilities </strike> comes a learning curve which disqualifies RCP/Expeditor for the casual developer. For the less casual there is the <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/compappwiki.nsf">Composite Applications wiki</a>. RCP or Expeditor applications are developed in Eclipse (surprise, surprise) using the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/downloads/toolkits.html#expeditor">Expeditor Toolkit</a>. You could extend Eclipse using <a href="http://www.instantiations.com/rcpdeveloper/index.html">RCP Developer</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/developer/application/">IBM Rational Application Developer</a>, IBM Lotus Widget Factory (part of Lotus Mashups) or <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/genservers/portletfactory/">WebSphere Portlet Factory</a>. Of course on of the biggest challenges (just see the lenght of this list item compared to the others) is to <a href="/blog/2006/11/volker-likes-expeditor-and-notes-8.html">explain Expeditor</a> in simple terms. </li> 
</ul> Conclusion: What platform is best for Enterprise developers? It depends. In any case Eclipse can be used as IDE for <b>any</b> of the above platforms. For new modules you definitely want to have a look at <b>HTML5</b>. Once you follow a modular approach, you need to find an aggregation engine. This can be serverside (IBM recommends <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/portal/">Portal</a> and <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/mashup-center/">Mashups</a>) or on the client (that would be <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/expeditor/">Lotus Expeditor</a>). I don't expect a large number of Expeditor based applications (in Expeditor lingo: plug-ins) for general consumption other than <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/plugin.nsf/home">Symphony extensions</a>, but I can see quite some enterprise uptake (ask your IBM client rep). 
<br> <b>Update</b>: Found a nice tutorial how to use <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-eclipse-webui/index.html">Web UI in Eclipse</a> applications. 
<br> As usual YMMV.</div>

  I am seeing more and more companies deploying Expeditor to &quot;workstations&quot; - like kiosks, call centers, tellers, etc. Expeditor is a great cross platform solution for these kinds of applications. Mix them with composites and you now mix web and rich content in a window manager. Many Notes shops are not familiar with Expeditor so they may not understand the platform under Notes 8.x.

  One important differentiation you forgot to mention for all the platforms is that of everything you listed above, Expeditor is the only one that will cost you licensing charges to deploy and use. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Every other technology in your list is free for deployment and use, and has free tools somewhere in the ecosystem to help build them.

  @Jonathan: hmm &quot; 
  <i>Expeditor is not free, but needs to be licensed</i>&quot; - what was unclear about that statement?

  Why doesn't IBM make Expeditor free to use and the apps generated bi Expeditor free to deploy, then (just as Domino Designer was &quot;liberated late in 2009)? What's the reason for the licensing restriction? Surely IBM can only benefit by liberating Expeditor too?
